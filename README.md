# Daniel Bowers QAP2

This project contains the following:

- MyPoint and MyLine classes
- MyRectangle class
- Money and CreditCard classes
- Test drivers for each class to validate their functionality

All code has been written in Java and tested thoroughly. The `images` folder contains my submission answers in PNG format.
